# Luas

The Luas is a tram service in Dublin, Ireland.

This is a simple Android app to display real time information about the nearest Luas stop to you.

## TODO

A list of things I'm planning to get done ordered vaguely by priority

* Decide on a name for the app
* Better UI
* Adding tests
* Removing the LuasApi singleton
* Backgrounding/resuming should update the currently selected stop based on most recent location information
* Smart polling for timetable updates while the app is open
* Fix the lint warnings
* Better location identifying (ie. actually search for your location instead of using last known location)
* CI somewhere
* Scheduled update of the Luas stops (don't want to get caught unawares by the blue line)
* Wearable tech
