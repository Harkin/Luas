# Luas

The Luas is a tram service in Dublin Ireland.

This is an Android app to display real time information about the nearest Luas stop to you.

This is an opinionated Luas app and my opinion is that you only care about times at the Luas stop nearest to you. For now, I have no plans to add in a way to browse times at any other stop.

## TODO

A list of things I'm planning to get done ordered vaguely by priority

* Better name for this project
* Backgrounding/resuming should update the currently selected stop based on most recent location information
* Better UI
* Smart polling for timetable updates
* Fix the lint warnings
* Better location identifying (ie. actually search for your location instead of using last known location)
* Scheduled update of the Luas stops (how often do these change? Blue line is probably the only time they will anytime soon)
* Wearable tech
